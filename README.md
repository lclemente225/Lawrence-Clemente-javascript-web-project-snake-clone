### My first javascript project
I spent a lot of time learning about querySelectors and game logic. It was difficult to reach the solution of using a grid of divs as the game board. Once I implemented this strategy, I was able to figure out changing the board size. Some stretch goals I had were creating the directional buttons to allow the game to be played on touch phones, making sure that the snake could not go in the direction opposite of its movement and resetting the snake and board whenever I changed the board size.
